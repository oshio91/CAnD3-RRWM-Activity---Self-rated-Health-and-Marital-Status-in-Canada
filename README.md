# CAnD3 RRWM Activity--Self-rated Health and Marital Status in Canada
This repository contains the program, codes, and instructions for replicating my analysis of self-rated health as a function of marital status and other sociodemographic characteristics of individuals in Canada. I used the Canadian GSS (General Social Survey), Cycle 31, 2017 family file.
